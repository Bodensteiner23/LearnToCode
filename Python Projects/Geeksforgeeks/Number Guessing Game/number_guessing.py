# Build a Number guessing game, in which the user selects a range.
# Letâ€™s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.
# Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that integer in the minimum number of guesses

# User selects Range from A to B
# Random Number between A and B is chosen
# User will iterate with inputs
